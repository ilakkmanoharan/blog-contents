# Database Backup and Recovery Strategies

Ensuring data safety is critical for any modern application. A robust backup and recovery plan protects against hardware failures, human errors, or cyberattacks. Regular full backups combined with incremental backups provide a reliable safety net while optimizing storage.

Automated backup scheduling and verification ensures consistency. Cloud-based solutions like AWS RDS snapshots or Azure SQL backups simplify management, offering easy recovery points and minimizing downtime during failures.

Disaster recovery strategies, such as geographically distributed replicas, complement backups. By maintaining hot or warm standby databases, organizations can quickly failover in case of catastrophic events, maintaining service continuity and data integrity.
