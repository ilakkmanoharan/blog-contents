# Scaling Databases for High-Traffic Applications

High-traffic applications require databases that can scale without compromising performance. Horizontal scaling, or sharding, distributes data across multiple servers, allowing systems to handle more requests simultaneously. This approach is ideal for web apps, e-commerce platforms, and social networks with growing user bases.

Vertical scaling, or upgrading server resources, can also improve performance but has limits. Combining vertical scaling for compute-heavy operations with horizontal sharding for data distribution creates a balanced architecture that can sustain peak loads efficiently.

Caching layers like Redis or Memcached further enhance scalability. Frequently accessed data is stored in-memory, reducing load on primary databases and improving response times. This multi-tiered approach ensures resilience, responsiveness, and cost-effective growth.
