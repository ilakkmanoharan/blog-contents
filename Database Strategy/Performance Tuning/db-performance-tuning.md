# Database Performance Tuning Techniques

Database performance tuning ensures efficient queries, minimal latency, and optimal resource usage. Indexing is a key strategy, allowing fast retrieval of frequently accessed records while reducing full table scans. Choosing the right type of index—B-tree, hash, or composite—depends on the query patterns.

Query optimization is another critical aspect. Analyzing execution plans, eliminating unnecessary joins, and reducing subqueries can dramatically improve speed. For distributed databases, partitioning data based on access patterns reduces contention and enhances parallel processing.

Monitoring tools provide real-time insights into bottlenecks. Metrics such as CPU usage, query latency, cache hit ratio, and connection pool utilization guide developers in fine-tuning configurations. A proactive tuning approach ensures high performance under growing workloads.
