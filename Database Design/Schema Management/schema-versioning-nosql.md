# Mastering Schema Versioning in NoSQL Databases

Schema evolution in NoSQL databases can be challenging due to their flexible nature. The best practice is to version attributes, for example, introducing `field_v2` while keeping `field_v1` intact. This ensures that older data remains compatible while enabling gradual migration of applications to new fields.

Gradual migration scripts play a critical role in avoiding production disruptions. By updating only a portion of records at a time, developers can monitor the impact and rollback changes if necessary. This controlled approach mitigates risks and maintains application stability.

For relationally complex systems, pairing versioned documents with a graph database can enhance querying and reporting. The combination allows teams to track both schema evolution and relational insights, ensuring that NoSQL flexibility doesnâ€™t compromise the integrity or analytical power of the system.
