# Optimizing API Performance with Query Batching and Response Caching

In high-performance backend systems, handling large volumes of requests efficiently is critical to maintaining low latency and high reliability. Two techniques that significantly improve API performance under load are **query batching** and **response caching**.

## Query Batching

Query batching involves combining multiple client requests into a single request to the backend or database. Instead of processing each request individually, the system executes them together, reducing redundant operations and minimizing network overhead.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced Database Load:** Fewer queries reduce contention and connection overhead.
* **Lower Latency for Bulk Requests:** Multiple requests are served in a single round trip.
* **Improved Throughput:** Backend can handle more requests per second.

**Implementation Example:**


# Example: Batch multiple ID lookups into a single database query
def get_users_batch(user_ids):
    # SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (user_ids)
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN :ids", ids=user_ids)

This approach prevents repetitive database hits when multiple resources are requested simultaneously.

## Response Caching

Caching stores the result of expensive computations or queries, allowing repeated requests for the same data to be served without hitting the backend repeatedly.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced Latency:** Cached responses are returned almost instantly.
* **Lower Backend Load:** Reduces redundant processing for frequent queries.
* **Enhanced Scalability:** System can handle high traffic with minimal resource strain.

**Implementation Example:**


import time
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def fetch_user_profile(user_id):
    # Simulate expensive DB query
    time.sleep(0.1)
    return db.get_user(user_id)


In production, distributed caching systems like **Redis** or **Memcached** are often used to serve cached responses across multiple instances of the API.

## Combined Impact

By applying **query batching** and **response caching**, APIs can achieve:

* Significantly lower latency, even under high load.
* More predictable performance for end-users.
* Reduced backend resource utilization, enabling better scalability.

**Example Metrics After Optimization:**

| Metric                       | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Average Latency (ms)         | 450                 | 120                |
| Requests per Second          | 500                 | 1500               |
| Database Queries per Request | 5                   | 1                  |

These improvements make the system more responsive, cost-efficient, and resilient to traffic spikes.
